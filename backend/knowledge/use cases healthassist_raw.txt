Express Scripts Holding Company 
(ESHC) is a pharmacy benefit 
management organization. The 
company's more than 30,000 
employees seMCe tens of millions  of 
members through facilities across the 
United States and Canada. 

ESHC's contact center handles 
-SOM  calls annually from members
seeking support with their order
status, refills and payments.

ESHC  sought to increase their call 
containment rate with a 
conversational IVR to reduce their 
contact center burden. 

The company's legacy solution relied 
on multiple non�conversational IVR 
bots, forcing employees to interad 
with multiple bots. 

The individual virtual assistants  were
domain-specific and therefore
unable to handle all individual 
member requests. 

Resolution of member calls often 
required support of multiple bots. 
This meant most callers experienced 
bot-to-bot transfers of their 
conversation and were more likely 
to request support from a live 
agent. 

A member seMCe  universal bot is 
created that interacts with multiple bots
(AuthenticatK)n, Refill request, Order 
Status, and Payment} to serve multi-tum 
requests from the customer. 

The company offered omnichannel 
conversational support experience. 
Callers are now able to engage with 
ESHC's support services across voice 
digital channels using IVR, SMS or chat. 

The universal bot handles large 
volume of calls, able to address 
indivx:fual  member requests w/o
members requiring to switch bots o r  
needing a live agent. 

Universal bot built on Kore.ai platform 
easily understands callers• intent, 
seamlessly handle  mutti�turn 
conversation by coordinating wrth 
other bots as needed and provide 
contextual responses t o  the user. 

The VA at ESI handles 30M calls 
with a goal to handle SOM calls 
annually. 

The universal virtual assistant plans 
to increase overall containment 
rates by 8% and realize $3M annual 
savings 

The value of domain-specific virtual 
assistant is maintained by distribution 
of intents across existing ones. 
Intents are also reused in other virtual 
assistants, which will reduce overall 
maintenance costs. 

Ongoing training and maintenance of 
all domain-specific virtual assistants 
is streamlined with updates to 
anyone.

This multinational energy supply leader In

the natural gas consumed in the US. 

The company grew Its workforce to 
15,000 In 2019-20, !n an effort to achieve 
its aggressive business obfe<tlves. 

The company updates its 15,000 
employee pay and benefits data every 6 
months which Is re-filed again during the 
annual open enrollment period. 

Employees were dependent on HR staff 
for !nfonnatlon access Including 
quest&ons about pay, PTO and benefits, 
whk.h took -30 m!n each. 

The staffing growth was further straining 
HR resources with slgnifkant increase in 
monthly calls and data management 
requirements. 

The burden of data management 
processes combined with appraisal 
cycles were taxing HR staff resources. 

The company developed an HR support 
virtual assistant "Mya" that automates 
HR related routine query responses. 

The already cumbersome employee 
data updates and infonnatlon 
exchanges were further exacerbated 
by high volum� of low•value, 
repetitive employee inquiries. 

As staff numbers Increased so did the 
number of routine HR queries each 
month. In-person inquiries and can 
volumes trended to be over 100 per 
day, preventing HR staff from 
addressing business priorities such as 
re<.ruitment and enrollment. 

Mya has over complex 50 dialog flows

accesses relevant enterprise data to 
inform quick, accurate responses to 
100• FAQs involving complex dialogs.

In the first 6 weeks of deployment 
Mya achieved a 90% containment

The qual!ty of automation and speed
